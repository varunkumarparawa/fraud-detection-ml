# 🚀 Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project was developed during assessment. It uses a dataset of 6.3 million+ financial transactions to detect and classify fraud using machine learning models.

## 📊 Project Goals
- Identify fraudulent transactions proactively
- Build ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
- Generate actionable business insights

## 🧠 Key Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Evaluation using AUC, Recall, Precision, and Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance and Insights
- Business Recommendations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn
- Google Colab
- Git & GitHub

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains 6,362,620 records with 10 features.
